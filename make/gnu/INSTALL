SYNOPSIS

  $ cd ${MJO_HOME}/make/gnu
  $ aclocal
  $ autoreconf -i
  $ ./configure
  $ make && make install

BUILDING

The files in this directory are for building mjo using GNU autotools.

Dependencies

  * C compiler
  * Linker
  * GNU Autotools
  * make

CONFIGURE SCRIPT

mjo can often be built using the GNU AUTOTOOLS macros and scripts supplied 
in the package. If this fails, it is might be necessary to rebuild
the scripts (see section below GNU AUTOTOOLS).

  $ cd ${MJO_HOME}/make/gnu
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

GNU AUTOTOOLS

To build mjo, change into the '${MJO_HOME}/make/gnu' directory.
Afterwards, run the the following GNU autotools commands in the
order listed:

  $ cd ${MJO_HOME}/make/gnu
  $ aclocal
  $ autoreconf -i

The next step is to configure. To accept the default settings,
run the following command:

  $ ./configure

To list all the configuration options, run the following command:

  $ ./configure --help

For mjo library, the most common parameter to change is the installation
path (prefix). For example, to configure the install to put files in a
users home directory you would run the following command:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/<username>/usr/local

compile

After following the steps described in section GNU AUTOTOOLS,
a 'Makefile' shall be created. To compile mjo run the following
command:

  $ make

install

Once mjo has been compiled, it can be installed into the configured
directory. To install mjo run the following command:

  $ make install
